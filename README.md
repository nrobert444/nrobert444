![Nick's github stats](https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api?username=nrobert444&hide=stars)

### Hi, I'm Nick!

I'm a full-stack JavaScript Developer in Portland, Oregon. I enjoy spending my days challenging myself with new technologies and interacting with the awesome dev community in Portland and beyond. My current favorite library/framework i'm working with is React w/Redux and i'm in the process of building a full-stack eCommerce platform for my online retail store.

### My next project will take me through learning Mobx w/ TypeScript to assist with a local business in need of an online platform update.
